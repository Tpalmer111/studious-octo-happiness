 1. Identify npm to use for the project.
    1. Follow install steps from developers on NPM website
    2. In Terminal type: ```npm install``` followed by the the NPM name (follow develper instructions).

    2. It is important to list the dependency files in a .gitignore file to avoid storing large amounts of unnecessary information on github.

    2. Get the clone, and use ```git clone``` to save the repository in a new directory.
    3. Open file in VSCode using ```code .```
